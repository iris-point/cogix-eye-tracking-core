# Why GitHub Actions Workflow Was Skipped

## The Problem
Your workflow was skipped because of the repository condition on line 25:
```yaml
if: github.repository == 'iris-point/eye-tracking-core'
```

This condition only allows the workflow to run if the repository is exactly named `iris-point/eye-tracking-core`, which likely doesn't match your actual repository name.

## âœ… Fixed!
I've removed this restriction so the workflow will now run on any repository.

## How to Test the Workflow

### Option 1: Manual Trigger (Recommended for Testing)
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Select "Publish to NPM" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" button
5. Choose release type (patch/minor/major)
6. Click green "Run workflow" button

### Option 2: Make a Meaningful Commit
```bash
# Instead of just "test", use proper commit format:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial package setup"  # This will trigger minor version bump
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Force Trigger with Any Commit
The workflow now also accepts commits without specific prefixes and will default to patch version bump.

## Commit Message Formats

The workflow looks for these commit prefixes:

| Commit Message | Version Bump | Example |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| `feat:` or `feature:` | Minor (0.0.1 â†’ 0.1.0) | `feat: add calibration UI` |
| `fix:` | Patch (0.0.1 â†’ 0.0.2) | `fix: connection issue` |
| `breaking:` or `major:` | Major (0.0.1 â†’ 1.0.0) | `breaking: API redesign` |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, etc. | Patch (0.0.1 â†’ 0.0.2) | `docs: update README` |
| Any other (like "test") | Patch (0.0.1 â†’ 0.0.2) | `test` or `update code` |

## Additional Workflow: Test Publish
I've also created a `test-publish.yml` workflow that:
- Runs on ALL branches (not just main)
- Does a dry-run to test if package can be built
- Shows package size and contents
- Validates version format
- Does NOT actually publish (safe for testing)

## Checklist Before Publishing

- [ ] NPM token added to GitHub Secrets as `NPM_TOKEN`
- [ ] You're logged in to npm locally: `npm whoami`
- [ ] Organization `@iris-point` exists on npm
- [ ] You have permission to publish to `@iris-point`

## Quick Commands

### Local Testing (without publishing)
```bash
# Build and pack locally (doesn't publish)
npm run build
npm pack --dry-run

# See what would be published
npm publish --dry-run
```

### Actual Publishing
```bash
# Manual from local machine
npm run release:patch  # 0.0.1 â†’ 0.0.2

# Or push to GitHub and let workflow handle it
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin main
```

## If Workflow Still Doesn't Run

1. **Check branch name**: Workflow runs on `main` or `master` branch
2. **Check Actions are enabled**: Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General â†’ Actions permissions
3. **Check workflow syntax**: Go to Actions tab, it will show syntax errors
4. **Manual trigger**: Use the "Run workflow" button to test

The workflow should now run successfully! ðŸš€
